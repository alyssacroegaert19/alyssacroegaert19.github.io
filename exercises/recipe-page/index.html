            <h1> <b> Ingredients </b> </h1>

            <ul>
                2 cups water
                2 cups evaporated milk
                6 to 8 cardamom pods, lightly crushed
                3 cinnamon sticks
                1 ginger cube (or a small piece of fresh ginger)
                1/4 cup light brown sugar (adjust to taste)
                1 teaspoon vanilla extract
                4 black/red tea bags

            </ul>

            <h1><b>Instructions</b></h1>

            <ol>

                <li>
                    In a medium pot, combine the water, evaporated milk,
                    cardamom pods, cinnamon sticks, and ginger.
                    Bring the mixture to a gentle boil over medium heat.
                </li>

                <br>

                <li>
                    Once it starts bubbling, reduce the heat to low and
                    let it simmer for about 5 to 7 minutes. This allows
                    the spices to infuse the milk and water with their
                    rich, warm flavors.
                </li>

                <br>

                <li>
                    Place the tea bags into the pot and let them steep
                    for 3 to 5 minutes, depending on how strong you like
                    your tea. Stir occasionally to help the tea blend
                    with the spiced milk. You’ll know it’s ready when
                    the color turns a deep, caramel brown. Stir in the
                    brown sugar until it dissolves completely.
                </li>

                <br>

                <li>
                    Add the vanilla extract and let it simmer for
                    another minute to enhance the flavor.
                </li>

                <br>

                <li>
                    Remove the pot from the heat and carefully
                    strain the tea into cups to remove the spices
                    and tea bags.
                </li>

                <br>

                <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
