            <h1> <b> Ingredients <b> <h1>

                </ul
                        2 cups water
                        2 cups evaporated milk
                        6 to 8 cardamom pods, lightly crushed
                        3 cinnamon sticks
                        1 ginger cube (or a small piece of fresh ginger)
                        1/4 cup light brown sugar (adjust to taste)
                        1 teaspoon vanilla extract
                        4 black/red tea bags

                </ul>

                <h1><b>Instructions<b></h1>

                <ol>
                    <li In a medium pot, combine the water, evaporated milk, car
                        damom pods, cinnamon sticks, and ginger.Bring the mixture to
                    a gentle boil over medium heat.</li> 
                    <br>

                    <li>Once it starts bubbling, reduce the heat to low and let
                    it simmer for about 5 to 7 minutes. This allows the spices to in
                    fuse the milk and water with their rich, warm flavors. </li>
                    <li>Place the tea bags into the pot and let them steep for 3 to 
                    5 minutes, depending on how strong you like your tea. Stir o
                    ccasionally to help the tea blend with the spiced milk. You’
                    ll know it’s ready when the color turns a deep, caramel brow
                    n. Stir in the brown sugar until it dissolves completely.
                    Add the vanilla extract and let it simmer for another minute
                     to enhance the flavor.
                    Remove the pot from the heat and carefully strain the tea in
                    to cups to remove the spices and tea bags.
                    Serve hot and enjoy!!
