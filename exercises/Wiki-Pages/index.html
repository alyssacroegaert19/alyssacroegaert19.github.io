            <b> Crown Shyness</b>Crown shyness (also canopy disengagement,<sup>[1]</sup>
                canopy shyness,<sup>[2]</sub> or inter-crown spacing<sup>[3])</sup>
                is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which the crowns
                of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy 
                with channel-like gaps.[4][5] The phenomenon is most prevalent am
                ong trees of the same species, but also occurs between trees of di
                fferent species.<sup>[6]</sup>[7]</sup> There exist many hypothes
                es as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research
                suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect lar
                vae.<sup>[8]</sup>

                    The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.
                    <sup>[6]</sup> The phenomenon has been discussed in 
                    scientific literature since the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup> 
                    The variety of hypotheses and experimental results might 
                    suggest that there are multiple mechanisms across different 
                    species, an example of convergent evolution.
