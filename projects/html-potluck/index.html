                <li> 2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
                <li> 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, softned </li>

            </ul>

            <h4> EGG WASH AND TOPPING<h4>

                <h4> Garlic Butter </h4>

                <ul>
                    <li> 1/4 cup melted salted butter </li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Instructions</h1>

                <ol>

                    <li><b> Activate the Yeast:</b> In a large mixing bowl, 
                        combine the warmmilk and sugar, then sprinkle the 
                        yeast over the top. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes 
                    until it’s foamy.</li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        <b>Prepare the Dough:</b> To the same mixing bowl, add 
                        the flour, salt, eggs, and softened butter. Mix 
                    until the dough starts to come together.</li>

                    <br>

                    <li><b> Knead the Dough:</b> Knead the dough on a floured 
                        surface for about 8-10 minutes until it’s smooth and 
                        elastic. Alternatively, use a stand mixer with a dough 
                    hook for 5-7 minutes on medium speed.</li>

                    <br>

                    <li><b> First Rise:</b> Transfer the dough to a greased bowl 
                        cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap, and let it 
                        rise in a warm spot for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in 
                    size.</li>
                    <br>

                    <li><b>Shape the Dough for Layers:</b> Punch down the dough 
                        to release the air. Divide the dough into equal 
                        portions, about 10 pieces. Take each portion of dough 
                        and flatten it out into a rectangle. Starting from one 
                        end, roll the dough tightly into a long log shape to 
                    create layers within each roll.</li>

                    <br>

                    <li><b> Place in Baking Tray:</b> Arrange the shaped rolls 
                        side by side in a greased baking tray, about 15 x 6 
                        inches, so they touch slightly. This will help them bake 
                    into a pull-apart style loaf</li>
                    <br>

                    <li><b>Second Rise:</b> Cover the rolls loosely and let them 
                    rise again for 30-45 minutes, or until puffy.</li>
                    <br>

                    <li><b>Apply the Egg Wash:</b> Preheat your oven to 375°F 
                        (190°C). Brush the tops of the rolls with the egg wash 
                    and sprinkle with sesame seeds.</li>
                    <br>

                    <li><b> Bake:</b> Bake the rolls for 15-20 minutes, or until 
                        golden brown on top. Remove from the oven and let 
                    them cool slightly.</li>
                    <br>

                    <li><b> Butter Topping and Toasting:</b> In a small bowl, 
                        combine melted salted butter with garlic powder.
                        Separate the rolls, brush them with the garlic butter 
                        mixture, and toast each roll on both sides in a skillet 
                    over medium heat until golden to enjoy.</li>

                        <li> 
                            In a medium pan, melt the butter over medium heat.
                        </li>

                        <br>

                    <h4> CRAB FILLING </h4>

                    <ol> 
                        <li>
                            In a large bowl, add the imitation crab meat, Kewpie 
                            mayo, soy sauce, egg white, and cream cheese. Mix 
                            until everything is well combined.
                        </li>

                        <br>

                        <li> 
                            Add the garlic powder, salt, black pepper, and 
                            chopped green onions. Stir to incorporate.
                        </li>
                           
                        <br>

                        <li>
                            Sprinkle in the cornstarch and gently fold it 
                            into the mixture to help bind the filling 
                            together. Set the crab filling aside
                        </li>

                    </ol>

                    <h4>PREPARE THE BREAD:</h4>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Take the stale white bread slices and trim off the 
                            crusts if preferred. You will need pairs of slices 
                            for each sandwich. 
                        </li>

                        <br>

                        <li>
                            You can leave the bread as whole slices or cut each 
                            slice in half for smaller sandwiches, depending on 
                            your preference.
                        </li>

                        <h4>ASSEMBLE:</h4>

                        <li>
                            Spread a generous amount of crab filling on one 
                            slice of bread in each pair. Top with a second slice
                            of bread to create a sandwich.
                        </li>

                        <br>

                        <li>
                            Press down lightly on the sandwich to ensure the 
                            filling adheres well.
                        </li>

                        <h4>FRY THE SANDWICHES:</h4>

                        <li>
                            Heat vegetable oil in a skillet or deep pan over 
                            medium heat, ensuring the oil is deep enough for 
                            shallow frying (about 1/4 to 1/2 inch).
                        </li>

                        <br>

                        <li>
                            Once the oil is hot, carefully place the sandwiches 
                            in the pan. Fry for 2-3 minutes until the bottom is 
                            golden and crispy.
                        </li>

                        <br>

                        <li>
                            Flip the sandwiches and fry the other side for 
                            another 2-3 minutes until it’s golden and crispy.
                        </li>

                        <h4>DRAIN AND SERVE:</h4>

                        <li>
                            Remove the sandwiches from the oil and place them on
                            a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.
                        </li>

                        <br>

                        <li>
                            Serve immediately with your favorite dipping sauces,
                            such as sweet chili or soy sauce.
                        </li>
