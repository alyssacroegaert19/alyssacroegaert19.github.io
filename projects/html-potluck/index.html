            <h1><b> Instructions</b></h1>

            <ol>

                <li><b> Activate the Yeast:</b> In a large mixing bowl, 
                    combine the warmmilk and sugar, then sprinkle the 
                    yeast over the top. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes 
                until it’s foamy.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b> Prepare the Dough:</b> To the same mixing bowl, add the 
                    flour, salt, eggs, and softened butter. Mix until the 
                dough starts to come together.</li>
                <br>

                <li><b> Knead the Dough:</b> Knead the dough on a floured 
                    surface for about 8-10 minutes until it’s smooth and 
                    elastic. Alternatively, use a stand mixer with a dough 
                hook for 5-7 minutes on medium speed.</li>
                <br>

                <li><b> First Rise:</b> Transfer the dough to a greased bowl, 
                    cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap, and let it 
                    rise in a warm spot for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in 
                size.</li>
                <br>

                <li><b>Shape the Dough for Layers:</b> Punch down the dough to 
                    release the air. Divide the dough into equal portions, 
                    about 10 pieces. Take each portion of dough and flatten 
                    it out into a rectangle. Starting from one end, roll the 
                    dough tightly into a long log shape to create layers 
                within each roll.</li>
                <br>

                <li><b> Place in Baking Tray:</b> Arrange the shaped rolls side 
                    by side in a greased baking tray, about 15 x 6 inches, 
                    so they touch slightly. This will help them bake into a 
                pull-apart style loaf</li>
                <br>

                <li><b>Second Rise:</b> Cover the rolls loosely and let them 
                rise again for 30-45 minutes, or until puffy.</li>
                <br>

                <li><b>Apply the Egg Wash:</b> Preheat your oven to 375°F 
                    (190°C). Brush the tops of the rolls with the egg wash 
                and sprinkle with sesame seeds.</li>
                <br>

                <li><b> Bake:</b> Bake the rolls for 15-20 minutes, or until 
                    golden brown on top. Remove from the oven and let 
                them cool slightly.</li>
                <br>

                <li><b> Butter Topping and Toasting:</b> In a small bowl, 
                    combine melted salted butter with garlic powder.
                    Separate the rolls, brush them with the garlic butter 
                    mixture, and toast each roll on both sides in a skillet 
                over medium heat until golden to enjoy.</li>
