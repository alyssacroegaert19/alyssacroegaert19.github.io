                    <h1><b>Making the Steak</b></h1>

                <p>
                    Let’s start with the star of the show—the steak! 
                    You’ll want thinly shaved steak to get that perfect 
                    cheesesteak texture. You can typically find thinly shaved 
                    ribeye steak at most grocery stores, either pre-sliced in 
                    the meat section or at the deli counter. Ribeye, sirloin, 
                    or flank steak are great options for this, and if you can’t 
                    find it pre-sliced, don’t worry—you can easily make it at home!
                </p>

                    <h4><b>How to Make Thinly Shaved Steak at Home:</b></h4>

                <p>
                    If your store doesn’t carry thinly shaved steak, it’s easy 
                    to make your own. Here’s what you need to do:
                </p>

                <ol>
                   <li><b>Freeze the Steak:</b> Place your steak in the freezer 
                    for about 30-45 minutes.
                    This firms it up, making it much easier to slice thinly.</li>
                <br>
                    <li><b>Slice Against the Grain:</b> After the steak firms up, remove it
                    from the freezer. 
                    Using a sharp knife, slice the steak thinly against the 
                    grain (those lines 
                    running through the meat). Aim for slices about 1/8 inch 
                    thick. If you have a mandoline slicer, you can use that for 
                    even thinner slices!</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Once your steak is ready, heat some butter and oil in a pan over medium-high 
                    heat, and toss the steak in once the pan is nice and hot. Season it with salt, 
                    paprika, mustard powder, and black pepper—this will give the steak all the 
                    flavor it needs. As the steak cooks, use a spatula to break it apart if 
                    necessary and ensure it gets evenly browned.

                    Once the steak is fully cooked, add the Worcestershire sauce, which will give 
                    the steak a rich, savory flavor. Next, deglaze the pan with some beef broth, 
                    scraping up all the delicious brown bits that have stuck to the bottom. 
                    Let the broth simmer for a couple of minutes to reduce and thicken into a 
                    flavorful sauce. Set the steak aside while you prep the veggies.
                <br>
                <p>
                    <b>Variation Tip:</b> If you like mushrooms, this is the perfect time to add some! 
                    Slice up some cremini or button mushrooms and toss them in with the steak. 
                    The mushrooms will absorb all that delicious broth and steak flavor, adding an 
                    extra layer of savory goodness to your sliders.
